# Find my hairdresser
The project "Find my hairdresser" from 2013 was voted as the best project by the participants and teachers in the course "Spatial Information Infrastructure". The Project allows users to get their nearest hairdressers displayed in a map. They can filter the hairdressers by the price they are willing to pay so that they only get results they are really interested in and they can also get detail information about each hairdresser, e.g. the opening times.
