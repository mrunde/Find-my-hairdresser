# Find my hairdresser

This project is part of the course *Spatial Information Infrastructure*, which took place at the [Institute for Geoinformatics, Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/index.html) in winter term 2013/14.

This project was voted as the best project by the participants and teachers. The Project allows users to get their nearest hairdressers displayed in a map. They can filter the hairdressers by the price they are willing to pay so that they only get results they are really interested in and they can also get detail information about each hairdresser, e.g. the opening times.
